Circuit Breaker
================
Netflix has created a library called Hystrix. 
It implements the circuit breakers pattern. 
Circuit breakers calculate when to open and 
close the circuit and what to do in case of failure. 
When all services fail at some point, 
the circuit breaker handles these failures gracefully. 
*****--> The circuit breakers have three states: 
OPEN, CLOSED, and HALF-OPEN State.
ex:  Hystrix, Resoulance4j (Recomended)

4. Messaging and routings
-------------------------
Routing and Messaging
-------------------
The cloud application made up of many microservices so 
the communication will be critical. Spring Cloud supports 
communication via messaging or HTTP request. 
Routing uses Netflix Ribbon and Open 
Feign while messaging uses Kafka or Rabbit MQ.

==========================================
API Gate Way
-------------
API Gateway
-------------
API Gateway allows us to route API request (external or internal) 
to connect services. It also provides a library for 
building an API gateway on the top of Spring MVC. 
Its aims to provide cross-cutting concerns to them, 
such as security and monitoring.
======================================
Tracing or Load balancing
---------------------------
--> Spring Cloud's other functionality is distributed tracing. 
Tracing is a single request to get data from the application. 
Tracing results in an exponentially larger number 
of requests to various microservices.

--> We can add Spring Cloud Sleuth library in our project to 
enable tracing. Sleuth is responsible for recording timing, 
which is used for latency analysis. 
We can export this timing to Zipkin.

--> Zipkin is a distributed tracing tool specially 
designed for analyzing latency problem inside the 
microservice architecture. It exposes 
HTTP endpoint used for collecting input data. 
If we required to add tracing in our project,
we should add the spring-cloud-starter-zipkin dependency.
==========================================================
Cl Pipeline and Testing
-----------------------
CI and CD (continioud integration and continioud dev)--> Docker
--> Junit,Junit5 mocking,cucumber..etc
========================
--> Spring Cloud pipeline is an 
opinionated (self-important) 
pipeline for Jenkins and Concourse, 
which creates pipeline automatically 
for the application. The building, 
testing, and deploying in various 
services is critical to having a 
successful cloud-native application.

--> The Jenkins pipeline provides a set 
of the tool designed for modeling simple 
and more advanced delivery pipeline as code. 
The definition of a pipeline 
is written into a text file called Jenkinsfile.

3. What is defference between monolithic and microservicess Applications?

--> What are problems with monolithic applications.
--> what are benefits with microservicess.
----------------------------------------------------
Monolithic architecture
----------------------
Monolithic architecture is the name for a specific 
software program form. The model is constructed in 
a single block (otherwise known as a “monolith”), 
with all components tightly coupled into a single, 
unit. A monolithic computing network will 
use one code base and runtime environment to create 
a single-tiered application. 
--> This means that multiple services, 
such as API’s, databases, load balancers, and more, 
will function as one large application organized 
into different layers. All the components
with in single folder system.
===================================================
DisAdavantages of Monolithic Application
------------------------------------------
The disadvantages of a monolith include:
-------------------------------------- 
Slower development speed – A large, monolithic 
application makes development more complex and slower.

Scalability – You can’t scale individual components.

Reliability – If there’s an error in any module, 
it could affect the entire application’s availability.

--> Barrier to technology adoption – Any changes in the framework or 
language affects the entire application, 
making changes often expensive and time-consuming.

Lack of flexibility – A monolith is constrained by the 
technologies already used in the monolith.

Deployment – A small change to a monolithic application 
requires the redeployment of the entire monolith.
