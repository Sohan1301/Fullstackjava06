encapsulation in java
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

exp1:
------
//A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.  
//It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.   
public class Student{  
//private data member  
private String name;  
//getter method for name  
public String getName(){  
return name;  
}  
//setter method for name  
public void setName(String name){  
this.name=name  
}  
}
